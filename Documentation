The TimeLine model:
Just like how animations are made, the user can insert actions at a specific time, or choose the Auto mode. After all key frames are\
settled, the calculator would calculate the whole process and then display it. User can replay this act in different time scales.

How spells are being processed:
1. The caster generates a SpellCast. The SpellCast will include damage value, damage type, amplifiers, buffs/debuffs, time casted and\
   time will receive.
2. The enemy receives the SpellCast, receives some dmg from runes, receives buffs/debuffs, triggers shields, receives damage.

//A spell cast will be generated by the caster and instantly received by the enemy, but will only take effect after a certain delay
//A spell cast contains information such as caster.name, amplifier.app, amplifier.appp
